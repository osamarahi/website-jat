        <h4>A Unique Heritage School .</h4>
        <p>A school is both the educational institution and building designed to provide learning spaces and
             learning environments for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems
              of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of 
              schools that can be built and operated by both government and private organization. The names for these school
              s vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young 
              children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education
               is taught is commonly called a university college or university </p>
